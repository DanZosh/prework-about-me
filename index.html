      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a Mechanical Engineer</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Ft. Lauderdale, Florida</p>

      <p>...but I had some short stints in Orlando, Chicago, the District of Columbia.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Right now, I'm really into skating. I just bought a fabulous pair of purple suede skates that are pretty fabulous</p>

      <p>I can't wait to take these puppies for a spin (they ship in 4-6 weeks) but I think given the fires, and the pending gloom, the season is over, I'll have to wait until next year.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Blimp Captain! Just kidding, my dream job is one where I'm involved in distrupting the construction industry. I'm not sure what that looks like yet. I'll let you know. Oh and one where I can work remotely.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in beautiful Othello, Seattle, Wa - but that might change to Coquitlam, BC if November goes a certain way...</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Construction industry tools are a bit antiquated and hard to use - looking at you Newforma, Bluebeam, Trane Trace, and to a lesser extent Revit</p>
